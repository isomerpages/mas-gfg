The Eminent Persons Group received valuable feedback from national authorities from a broad range of developing and advanced countries, and benefited from extensive consultations with the international financial institutions (IFIs). We also benefited from the contributions and perspectives of individuals with deep experience in national and international policy-making; thought leaders from civil society, academia, think tanks and philanthropic organizations; and private sector leaders and experts in infrastructure investment, financial technology and other areas.

The Group would like to thank all these organizations and individuals for their candid and constructive views, in discussions and written submissions. Refer to the report for the list of contributions.

The Group wishes to acknowledge the generous support from the Bank of England, Banque de France, Deutsche Bundesbank, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Hoover Institution, Stanford University for hosting some of its meetings.
