The conversation discussed the key recommendations of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance (EPG)’s Report. The Group called for reforms to meet the realities of a new era: a multipolar, yet more interconnected world; with development challenges ahead that are much larger than we have seen in decades; and with significant work still needed to avert damaging financial crises.

A decade after the global financial crisis, further reforms are needed to enable countries to get the full benefits of capital flows without the bouts of instability that set back growth, and to avert another major global crisis. This panel discussed the Group’s proposals on issues concerning capital flows, risk surveillance, and the global financial safety net.
