*     to review current and possible future challenges and opportunities facing the international financial and monetary systems, and the current state of the global financial architecture and governance;

*     to consider, having regard to relevant past reviews, the optimal role of the international financial institutions (IFIs) comprising the IMF, the WBG, and other multilateral development banks, including how these IFIs interact and coordinate with one another, with the G20, and with their respective memberships; their capacity to catalyze private capital flows and domestic resources; and corporate governance and accountability structures, to ensure efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in addressing the challenges identified;
  
*     to recommend practical reforms to improve the functioning of the global financial architecture and governance so as to promote economic stability and sustainable growth; and to discuss how the G20 could better provide continued leadership and support for these goals.

* The Groupâ€™s work will not duplicate existing efforts in the G20 and the IFIs related to Shareholding Reviews and the IMF General Review of Quotas.

* The Group will provide its findings and recommendations to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors for their deliberation. Decisions on any proposals concerning the IFIs would have to be made by their respective governing bodies.

* The Group will provide an outline of its work to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at the IMF/WBG Annual Meetings 2017.
